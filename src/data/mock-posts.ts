		imageUrl: 'https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27448W-L.jpg',
		excerpt:
			"Frodo Baggins inherits a ring of terrible power and learns it must be destroyed in Mount Doom. He joins a fellowship of hobbits, men, an elf, a dwarf, and a wizard. Crossing snowy passes and ancient mines, they face betrayal and break apart, yet the quest continues toward the shadow growing in the East. Tolkien weaves songs, histories, and languages into the journey, giving Middle-earth a lived-in depth. The Ring tempts each bearer differently, revealing how power corrodes even the noble. Moments of hospitality—from Rivendell's council to Lothlórien's gifts—offer grace amid looming war. When the fellowship fractures, the story insists that courage can be quiet: a gardener refusing to abandon his friend, a ranger choosing mercy over vengeance.",

			'The Hobbit — J.R.R. Tolkien. A reluctant hero, a stolen treasure, and the road to the Lonely Mountain.',
		imageUrl: 'https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL26331930M-L.jpg',
		excerpt:
			"Bilbo Baggins leaves his cozy hobbit-hole to join thirteen dwarves on a quest to reclaim their mountain home from the dragon Smaug. Guided by Gandalf, Bilbo faces trolls, riddling in the dark, and a perilous forest. Along the way he finds a mysterious ring and discovers courage he never suspected he possessed. Tolkien balances danger with humor, from barrel rides to spider banter, while hinting at the wider world of elves, men, and ancient grudges. Bilbo's quick wits prove as valuable as swords, showing that heroism can look like clever words and steady nerves. By the journey's end, treasure matters less than friendship and a newfound sense of self, setting the stage for larger battles to come in Middle-earth.",

			'Dune — Frank Herbert. Desert power, politics, and prophecy on the sands of Arrakis.',
		imageUrl: 'https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL26336018M-L.jpg',
		excerpt:
			"House Atreides takes control of Arrakis, sole source of the spice that fuels interstellar travel. Young Paul Atreides is thrust into betrayal and exile among the Fremen, learning their ways in the deep desert. Visions of futures and the weight of prophecy press on him as rival powers clash over the sands. Herbert crafts ecology and politics as intertwined forces: sandworms, water discipline, and imperial schemes all shape destiny. The story balances court intrigue with mythic overtones, questioning whether a messiah can avoid becoming a tyrant. As Paul steps into the role of Muad'Dib, the novel wonders whether foresight frees him or traps him, and what it costs a people to hitch hope to a single figure.",

		imageUrl: 'https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL26352798M-L.jpg',
		excerpt:
			"Santiago, a shepherd, dreams of treasure near the pyramids and sets off with little more than hope. Along the way he meets a crystal merchant, an Englishman studying alchemy, and a wise alchemist who teaches him to listen to omens. The journey reveals that the treasure he seeks is intertwined with understanding his own heart. Coelho blends parable and adventure, suggesting that the world conspires to help those who pursue their true path. Crossing deserts, Santiago learns that love and purpose need not conflict; they can align when one is faithful to a calling. The story's simplicity hides a layered message about fear, intuition, and the courage to act on dreams before they calcify into regret.",
